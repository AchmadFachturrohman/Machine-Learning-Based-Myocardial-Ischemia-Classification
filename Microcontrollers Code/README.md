# ECG-Recording-With-Microcontrollers 
This is a microcontroller program that I have built to record the ECG signal. The devices that I used are [Mikromedia 4 for STM32F4](https://mikroe.com/mikromedia-4-for-stm32-capacitive), medical instrumentation [ECG Click](https://www.mikroe.com/ecg-click) and serial communication [USB UART Click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) from Mikroe. The Multiparameter Simulator MS400 is used for the ECG signal generator for ischemic heart signals such as ST-wave elevation and ST-wave depression. I chose the elevation and depression signals with 0.2 mV, 0.3 mV, and 0.4 mV (positive value is the elevation and negative value is the depression). Recording took 2-6 minutes for every signal. MS400 has three electrodes that connect to the ECG Click's 3.5 jack. Those recordings used a 250 Hz of sampling frequency. The recorded signal is then saved in text format. The output of the microcontroller is the raw data of the ECG signal recording with the MS400. Its also used to create the DWT algorithm. After the DWT algorithm is obtained. Then the DWT algorithm is embedded into the microcontroller after which recording is done again by taking the data from the decomposition of the recording directly to validate whether the results of the embedded DWT with the calculation of the DWT algorithm that has been built are similar or not. If so, the next stage is to record again by taking the embedded DWT decomposition data for 2â€“6 minutes to create a training model dataset, and vice versa if not, the development of the DWT algorithm that has been made previously will be carried out.
