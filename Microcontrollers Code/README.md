# ECG-Recording-Microcontrollers 
This is a microcontroller program that I have built to record the ECG signal. The devices that I use are [Mikromedia 4 for STM32F4](https://mikroe.com/mikromedia-4-for-stm32-capacitive), medical instrumentation [ECG Click](https://www.mikroe.com/ecg-click) and serial communication [USB UART Click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) from Mikroe. Then the Multiparameter Simulator MS400 is the signal generator for ischemic heart signals such as ST-wave elevation and depression signals. I chose the elevation and depression signals with 0.2 mV, 0.3 mV, and 0.4 mV (positive is the elevation value and negative is the depression value). Recording took six minutes for every signal. MS400 has three electrodes that connect to the ECG Click's 3.5 jack. Those recordings used a sampling frequency of 250 Hz. The recorded signal is then saved in text format. After that, the saved signal is then processed using a discrete wavelet transform. Further processing of the ECG signal available in DWT folder
