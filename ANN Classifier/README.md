# ANN to classify the decomposed and peaks detected of ECG signals
This program is the result of my research on the detection of myocardial ischemia using an artificial neural network classifier. The dataset used in this study was obtained from discrete wavelet transforms, such as the 5th-scale decomposed signal and ECG peaks. From the tests I did, I got the best results with data containing signal information decomposed on a 5-point scale with 96.17% accuracy, 93.08% precision, 95.6% specificity, and 97.11% sensitivity.
