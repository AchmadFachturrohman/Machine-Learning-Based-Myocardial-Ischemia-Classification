# Machine-Learning-Based-Myocardial-Ischemia-Classification
 This is my final research project for my bachelor's degree. The research is divided into three parts. First, it is about how I get the ECG ischemic signal. Second, on how I process the signal to get all the ECG peaks. Third, on how I use the ANN to determine whether the patient is normal or ischemic.
