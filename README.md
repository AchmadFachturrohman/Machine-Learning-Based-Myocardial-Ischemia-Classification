# Machine-Learning-Based-Myocardial-Ischemia-Classification
 This is my final research project for my bachelor's degree. The research is divided into three parts. First, it is about how I get the ECG ischemic signal. Second, on how I process the signal to get all the ECG peaks. Third, on how I use the ANN to determine whether the patient is normal or ischemic.
 
This project is currently in the process of publication at the International Conference on Electronics, Biomedical Engineering, and Health Informatics (ICEBEHI) with the title Embedded Discrete Wavelet Transform for Real-Time Delineation of Wearable Electrocardiograph to Detect Myocardial Ischemia. If you use code or algorithms from this repository please include my article in your research article. The link article will be published later. Thank you & Have a nice research.
