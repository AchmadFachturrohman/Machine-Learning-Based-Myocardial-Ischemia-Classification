# Machine-Learning-Based-Myocardial-Ischemia-Classification
Ischemia is a heart disease caused by atherosclerosis, namely narrowing of blood vessels caused by the buildup of cholesterol in the form of plaque in the blood vessels. Plaque causes blood flow back to the heart is blocked. The heart muscle is deprived of oxygen, reducing its ability to pump blood. If this condition occurs continuously, it can lead to heart attack or complications of myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograph (ECG) is the most widely used non-invasive monitoring of the heart's electrical signals in hospitals. In previous studies, many myocardial ischemia detection systems had been carried out with various signal processing methods, but the system had not been embedded in a microcontroller. Therefore, this study proposed to detect myocardial ischemia using microcontroller with wearable ECG. This study aims to help patients find out early on their heart condition against ischemic heart disease and avoid heart attack complications because the result can be shown in touchscreen display. The proposed device is used to record cardiac signals by processing digital signals using Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) embedded in an ARM microcontroller. The signal processing results obtained peaks of P, QRS, and T waves based on 5 decomposition scales, then proceeded with classification using artificial neural networks. The classification process is categorized into normal and ischemia. The classification results were obtained with an accuracy of 96.17%, precision 93.08%, specificity 95.6%, and sensitivity 97.11%. The proposed method is useful in study of myocardial infarction and can be applied at the clinical level.
